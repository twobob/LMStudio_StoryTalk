This is a short example.

It spans several lines of text.

They end with the full-stop character, also known as "Period".

Having a file called "story.txt" in a folder will cause it to be rendered, assuming it has not already.

Each sentence will be rendered, the relative speed of the speech can be controlled via SPEAKER_SPEED and is set to 0.9 out of the box.

The generation is then checked for suitability, using whisper, with a degree of confidence, regenerating if it fails the test.

The adjustment in the code for the degree of confidence is called GIBBERISH_DETECTION_THRESHOLD and defaults to 0.85.

The samples that pass this test are then optionally upsampled to 48 k. This parameter is called UPSAMPLE and the default value is "True".

Finally a neural noise reduction model is used to clean the results. The amount by which the signal is cleaned is set with the variable NOISE_REDUCTION_PROPORTION and it defaults to 0.4.

This concludes our exciting example explanation.
